# Selve-javascript-library
A Selve USB RF Gateway library to activate Selve Sun Screens, written in Javascript.
It supports the 2-way Commeo XML based protocol.
The Selve USB RF Gateway documentation can be downloaded form the www.selve.de website. Both in English and German Language.

This libraray is used in combination with nodejs webservices also written in Javascript. These webservice is part of my IoT home domotica.

To be continued, still work in progress.
